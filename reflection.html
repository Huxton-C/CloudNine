									<h3 class="major">Individual Reflections</h3>

									<h4>Muhammad Umer Khan</h4>
									<p>The group that sir made went well as it was easy for me to get connected since most of the group was in class or was at least contacting. I was able to understand what I should start doing when our group made a google doc to divide all the work at an early point of the assignment and not on the last minute. I believe that dividing some of the harder tasks for more people to do would have been better, so everyone could have done the work together, with help and with the same effort put in (not someone doing more than the rest of the members). I personally found the jobs my group members decided to put in their ideal jobs surprising as I did not even know some existed or learnt about how much experience and knowledge is required to get some jobs. Also was surprised about how the employers have ranked the skills required for some IT jobs. A new thing I have learnt about groups includes on how work should equally divide as the group I started User-Centered Design with was not really like this. I also learnt how being in a group means you should be answering any trouble or questions the members have to show the interest and care you have for each other.</p>

									<h4>Shahan Sarvari</h4>
									<p>I believe as a group, we worked well together as we managed to assign every aspect of the assignment to different group members. Our online meetings were also very important in finding out who needed help and where everyone was at in their contributions. Some things that could have been improved were the initial time it took us a collective to decide who was going to do what. I think we also took too long in deciding a project idea and this proved to be an issue until the last week of the due date of the assignment. One part of the assignment that surprised me was how selfless and helpful my group members were, they constantly asked me if I needed help with anything and provided me with support. I think the website reflects how much time and effort was actually put into this assignment which is a relief as I know our hard work is actually being shown in a brilliant way.</p>

									<h4>Annie Huang</h4>
									<p>The group worked well together and it was smooth sailing for the majority of the time. We all tried our best to contribute to the assignment and help each other out when needed. Our communication was fairly efficient and suggestions were considered by all group members. For those that showed up to all the meetings and participated in the assignment the whole way through, I believe we had good teamwork and cooperation, allowing the completion to be more smooth and easier than we thought. Although we were given plenty of time to complete this assignment, I believe we should’ve started on the work sooner instead of leaving it so last minute as this left us more stressed and frantic when trying to complete the work. There were times where not all the members could participate in the group meetings which also could be improved on. What I found surprising was how quick and efficiently the work was done once we assigned tasks to each member and gave ourselves a timed goal. One thing I learnt was that communication is key which significantly improves teamwork. Having someone with a leadership role is also very beneficial.</p>

									<h4>Huxton Chalmers</h4>
									<p>When we did end up having our meetings I feel I communicated very well and spoke up when needed while still being able to listen as we had a real ease conversing in that setting. There was no real conflict in this sense, and we all were helpful and very friendly. When doing this project of the tutor/student finder I procrastinated a lot and didn’t really crack down on getting my work done until very late at night when I ran out of things to watch and typed everything in a sleepy haze so my work may not be the most coherent thing. What was surprising to me was how quickly I was able to develop new ideas and collaborate with my peers on this new topic idea that we chose very late as we could not think of enough for our first project idea. Having a team all work together on this surprisingly was quite easy and led to more detailed response. One thing I learnt was that it is very important to get communication going early so there is not a big stress and concern about others in the final week. Try to start conversations and ensure you show up at meetings.</p>

									<h4>Ahmed Jazeel</h4>
									<p>One of the aspects that went well with this group assignment was that there was a sense of accountability once we started to get into completing the assignment. Everyone in the group stepped up and did their part for the successful completion of the assignment. Additionally, the majority of the team members were keen on helping other team members with their respective parts if they were unable to do so. However, I felt that as a group we could have communicated better in regards to how everyone was going with the assignment. I felt that we were unorganised and had no clear steps or outlined. We as a group should get better at delegating tasks for the upcoming assignment.  Something that surprised me was that we had no team leaders appointed but some team members took on that role regardless to push us to meet deadlines. The one thing that I learned about working in groups was to compromise, as a team, we should be able to compromise and work on the subject matter that we specialise in. The meetings that we had via Teams was a saving grace as this helped us keep on track and focus on what we needed to complete. The meetings also created a sense of urgency which was crucial.</p>

									<h4>Muhammad Imran</h4>
									<p>What I think went well was us working as a team and having group meetings regularly to keep each other updated. Everyone is really friendly and was offering help to each other to get the assignment done to the highest level. Everyone stepped offered help to each other or volunteered to do a certain task and got it completed. Personally, I think communication could be improved. As, at times people would be waiting for others to get their part in. Even though it is already done but due to lack of communication it was confusing for everyone to reach a conclusion, other than that everything went really well. One thing that was surprising to me was that everyone was so helpful and nice as in most groups people just expect to get your part in with no update or help. In our group people stepped up or personally contacted others to help them or ask for help rather than leaving it last minute. I have learned a lot about my group members, and one of those things is that my group members can reach a conclusion successfully without too many issues. We have all gotten closer as a group and are able to work together as a team and reach a final decision that we all can agree on.</p>

									<h4>Alex Trinh</h4>
									<p>I believe that the group had a bit of a rocky start with nothing quite working well at the beginning. However, as time passed, we started to be more cooperative and became more organised assigning each group member with a task on the assignment. Having weekly meetings, we updated each other on where everyone was up to and if anyone needed help on their parts. I would say there could be numerous things that could be improved. This includes, maybe being more confident in ourselves and able to decide things quickly and efficiently rather than letting things dwell. That way we spend more time on the quality of our work rather than dragging out discussion. There could also have been better communication amongst the group. Nevertheless, the assignment went well and everyone contributed to their part. One thing that was surprising was the amount of work everyone did. The group members have shown that they have been able to complete the work excellently meeting the criteria in the assignment. One thing that I learnt is that every group member needs to participate in order for progress to flow well. As if a one group member falls behind the whole group follows.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Group Reflection</h3>
									<p>We as a group feel we didn’t actually start our project until far too late making it rather stressful to sort everything out such as who is doing what and timeframes of work completion leading to a mad dash to try get the work done to a high standard.
									<p>In fact, starting on it earlier would’ve made us get the hang of communicating using our 7desired platform quicker leading to a more open dialogue and being more collaborative and being able to provide more detailed responses to the questions asked on the specification as more minds thinking on everything means more ideas and different viewpoints. Delegations of roles also should've been created earlier in order to stay organised and up to date.</p>
									<p>Our line of communication was rather lackluster and wasn’t very responsive leading to a lot of stress and confusion over the status of certain sections of the project getting completed on time.</p>
									<p>Once we did get started however, I feel our group individually did all our work quite efficiently and to a good standard even though it was pushed out so quickly. We used what little time we had left efficiently, especially seeing as most group members also had other commitments and group assignments in this time frame. Our group members were very willing to help each other out with any tasks that needed to be completed. We also had frequent online meetings that allowed us to come together, discuss the assignment and highlight any concerns we had.</p>
									<p>In the future, we aim to set group goals which should be achieved by the end of each week before the next meeting. This can allow for the divided tasks to be finished early, so there is enough time to polish and so members are able to move on to help others in need.</p>
									<p>Something some of the group members found surprising was that we did not choose a group leader at any point throughout the whole assignment, A leadership role could have guided us, as they could have done a better job delegating tasks among all group members. A group leader would have also helped us keep perspective on the deadline and helped make us informed decisions.</p>
									<p>All the group members contributed equally in the assignment, however there were some delays as some tasks needed to be read clearly so they could have been split amongst more members making it more fair. This occurred for the IT technologies section as it was originally given to 2 members which was a much greater task than we anticipated, which was then distributed to 2 more members.</p>
