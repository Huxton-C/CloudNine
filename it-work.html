									<h4>What kind of work is done by the IT professional? </h4>
									<p>The IT professional I interviewed works as a security engineer who specializes in cybersecurity for Unico computer systems. They are part of a team that works in the internal IT team that is responsible for establishing and implementing security systems to defend the companies’ digital assets. They work by evaluating security needs in the company on a day-to-day basis by establishing some best practices and standards. By doing this they can follow, design, and implement solutions that upgrade the company’s existing security measures to protect the organisation's data systems and networks. They are part of the internal team. At present they do not necessarily provide external cybersecurity support services for other companies. Additionally, due to the nature of working in a small team, their role of responsibilities is not restricted to only cybersecurity, they also work with other technologies such as network security, device security and authentication.</p>

									<h4>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The public?</h4>
									<p>The IT professional works closely with five team members. One of them is their manager who is the Chief information security officer that they directly report to. Additionally, some of the other team members are well experienced senior network security engineer, security engineer that specialises in authentication and an engineer that specialises in antimalware/endpoint protection. Tariq stated that they use this opportunity to learn from them as their experience is valuable.  They also work with other internal stakeholders such as departments team leads to cater to their personal security needs. Moreover, they also work with external stakeholders such as customers in the instance where they require access to the company database. It is their responsibility to provide for the needs of the customers without compromising the security of the company. They also work with IT professionals external to the business in the form of vendors occasionally to make sure that both parties have a common understanding of security requirements. The IT professional also works with clients sometimes when it comes to questions regarding the security posture of Unico.  They do not have interactions with investors or the general public.</p>

									<h4>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h4>
									<p>As a security engineer, it is crucial to be prudent and anticipate potential attacks as they are the first line of defence against any external threats to their network. Most of the time they spend is on day-to-day tasks such as violations of security procedures and monitor reports regarding suspicious activity on their networks. They also spend time identifying malware on the networks and investigate security logs to mitigate risks. Performing risk assessments and execution of tests for diagnostics to identify vulnerabilities. Tariq also works on scheduling change procedures accordingly without causing disruptions to other services. Additionally, they also spend time learning about technologies from their experienced senior members.</p>

									<h4>An example of a security breach or a ticket that you were recently worked on?</h4>
									<p>The IT professional talked about a situation where one of their colleagues got tricked into clicking on a phishing email that resulted in a malicious code being downloaded while they were on the network. They stated that this was a major security breach internally. They also talked about how it was not a straightforward task to simply ask the user to disconnect the device from the network. A procedure was followed to mitigate the issue which was to disable their network access remotely, seize the user's machine, examine network logs to identify the communication activity that originated from the system and finally format the device and reprovision the user. They also stated that upon analysing the code the findings were that it was designed to mine Bitcoin and posed no significant threat to their digital assets. However, they did reiterate that there could have been major consequences if the code were designed to compromise security or spread onto the network.</p>

									<h4>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h4>
									<p>The IT professional states that the job comes with the challenge of being ready for the worst eventuality, they have to be aware and up to date of what is going on in the existing system at all times. The job comes with the responsibility of neutralising any potential risk at any moment. Because of this the professional talks about how they are not able to simply ‘shut off’ from work but be constantly aware and always monitor events during off-hours and keep an eye out for anything that might potentially harm their digital assets. Additionally, they state that it is important to be aware of new trends and new risks that might arise therefore maintaining a culture of continuous learning during their off-hours is also important.  They also state that working on new technologies can be challenging at first but the upside is that it is always rewarding in the end.</p>

									<h4>Example of something that you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry.</h4>
									<p>The opportunity to work on projects, They stated that they worked on an internal phishing test within users of the company, and they generated a report of the users that clicked on the fake link and submitted their credentials on their test page. With the generated report they were able to escalate their findings to the senior-level executives in the company. Relatively a higher number of users were identified for falling for these email threats. Because of the high numbers, they gained the support of management for the improvement of security in terms of authentication which opened up the possibility to another project which was to implement multi-factor authentication. They stated that the overall result was very rewarding which meant that the company was secure in regards to phishing threats at present. The essence that stands out to me is that whilst working in the IT industry, collaboration will occur and working on projects like this brings teams together regardless of it being IT personnel or non-IT personnel.</p>
