									<h4>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h4>
									<p>The highest-ranked IT-specific skill that is demanded from employers that our group members need is Huxton and Ahmed. This being SQL programming which has the highest demand by employers having 3,570 job postings. The second highest skill with high demand which is java scripting with 2,946 job postings is needed for Alex and the web designing. The next skill demanded from employers ranked 7th is business management with 2,141 job posting for Muhammad Imran as he will be doing business with software developers working for him. Ranked 14th in skill demanded is LINUX with 1,632 job postings required from Huxton another coding language required for cloud engineering.</p>

									<p>Annie needs the 15th ranked skill with 1,372 job postings being software engineering as her job is software engineering for cybersecurity. With the 22nd highest rank in skill with 1,150 job postings is python coding required from Shahan and Huxton being one the most used coding languages in 2021. Ahmed is required to get business processing rank 25th with 1,033 job postings as the IT field he wants is related to business. Ranked 26th with 1,016 job postings being Cisco and Ranked 30th with 880 job postings being network engineering both for Muhammad Khan to fulfill these requirements to get into network engineering.</p>

									<h4>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h4>
									<p>The highest-ranked general skill that is demanded from employers is required by our entire group. This skill is the communication skill having 44,367 job postings and being needed by mostly all types of IT-related jobs as a skill. Alex needs the second-highest skill with 16,445 job postings being problem-solving as it will be needed for the three different types of coding languages. The 5th highest skill demanded by employers with 14,364 job postings is team building/work for Huxton, Annie, Shahan, and Muhammad Khan. This would be needed as the jobs the group members will be working in will require teams and group cooperation. The 11th highest ranked skill demanded by employers is leadership with 5,144 job postings needed for Muhammad Imran and Ahmed as they will working in areas where they will be guiding the group of employees they work with.</p>

									<h4>What are the three highest-ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h4>
									<p>The three highest IT-specific skills were SQL, Javascript, and JAVA. The two highest skills are required by our group members to get their jobs, but the only skill that was not needed being JAVA. The skills our group members chose to need to include some Java-related elements but in their job seeker website, it appears they were not asked to have this specific skill to receive the job.</p>

									<h4>What are the three highest-ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h4>
									<p>The three highest general skills were communication, problem-solving and organizational skills. This is again the same, the third-highest skill was in the skills required by our group members. However, the skills are required by everyone regardless of if it is an IT job or not, having organizational skills is important but it seems that none of our group members needed this skill from the job seeker employers trying to hire.</p>

									<h4>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h4>
									<p>Most of our group members would change our ideal jobs only if the rank of the job in demand is low or not on the list at all. The skills to most of us do not matter as the general skills are needed in most jobs. The IT-specific skills do matter as these will be important and needed for the future. The IT-specific skills are more long term and if one us decide on changing our mind on the job because of the skills will matter in the future as these skills will be needed later but maybe not many jobs needed it right now. Most of us do not really care about the skills as much as the job ranking by the employers as they currently matter.</p>
