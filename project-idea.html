									<p>We have discussed choosing Alex Trinh’s project idea as it is more unique and challenging.  The project idea is an application that helps students find the right tutors. Education is one of the top priorities for the up-and-coming generation. Therefore, we feel this app should be created. The app will consist of profiles of tutors acting as advertisements on what subjects they teach with ratings shown to students. That way students can choose a tutor that is right for them. With tutors and students using the app, they can both provide feedback each other anonymously providing that person with an insight on how they could improve and better their practice.</p>

									<h4>Overview:</h4>
									<p>To create a service that allows our users to either be a student searching for a tutor to find one or alternatively allowing a tutor to find students to help with their education. The application will achieve this by being formatted in a tinder or Grindr dating app style interface where the user can scroll or swipe through other users and create matches. With these matches they can start to message them and organize a study meet. This way of finding tutors allows for users to find people they can better get along with making the tutoring process a lot more enjoyable.</p>

									<h4>Motivation:</h4>
									<p>The reason for the making of this app was due to wanting a more simple and accessible way to find a tutor with a lot of school’s services for finding tutors are not the greatest.  They can take far too long, and you just do not get the chance to know if the person teaches the right way for your learning style. Sometimes people just do not get one another and there is not a click and having a profile for each tutor they can customize lets the students see what they are like and decide if its their type of person. Education is one of the top priorities for the up-and-coming generation. Therefore, we feel an app like this is necessary, especially in the age of covid when teaching resources can be hard to fully experience from one source as online learning is a struggle for many.</p>

									<h4>Description:</h4>
									<p>The program will be a dating style application similar in layout to that of Grindr. It will feature an account creation system where your details and profile are linked to your account that you create so you have a specific and individual identity. Profiles for each account will have various details about the person such as name, gender, preferred pronouns, subjects specialized, location/proximity to you, available times, photo of them? And their price range (if a tutor). All profiles will be displayed to the students in a big list they can scroll through and tap on profiles to view more information about the individuals they end up selecting. The list displayed will be curated and only show the user people who match their preferences of subjects and relative distance to them.  Users who select tutor will be able to set a fixed or ranging price for their lessons by the hour, day or any other specified time frame, that can be displayed to the students and paid directly through the app by sending each other a lesson request in app with the date of lesson and other such info on the invoice. By using an in-app method for payment liability can be placed upon the users to conduct the lesson and provide the service so the students can be confident their purchase is safe and secure. Once 2 users show interest in each other it will match them together and send them a notification of this showing they now have access to the chat feature with this user and can start a conversation and organise their session together. There will be a calendar section on the app, that can be exported and saved to Google calendar or Microsoft calendar or Apple calendar, that will when confirm a meeting with your matched user it will put this onto the calendar so that the student and tutor does not miss out on their appointment. If you no longer wish to be matched with another user for any particular reason, you will be able to unmatch with them and provide them with a small slip of feedback that will go to their feedback section with other feedback they receive from users. Originally, we had planned to add a star rating system to all our users that was publicly visible on their profile, however we elected to not go with this option as we believed it would create a negative environment on the app and focus more on a rating rather then education which is the most import part of this all to us. Hence why we went for the anonymous private feedback format because we believe is more productive to have this form of feedback and won’t create a sort of power vacuum.</p>


									<h4>Tools and Tech:</h4>
									<p>To make this program we will need to use an app development platform such as Appy Pie, Zoho Creator or Appsheet. However, some of these programs have a cost a fair bit of money and have rather limited free or trial version with watermarks or crucial features completely missing so we will most likely use Flutter or swing2app as they are open source as well as free and easy to use. To design our app, we would need a space to design and understand the flow and format of the application. A great program for us to understand this would be Figma a program used to design app layouts and workflow in said app. Some collaborative software should also be used to pool together our work as we produce this software. We will most likely use GitHub as its push and pull features allow for everyone to edit specific sections and apply them to the base which is highly useful for a team project. Also, we have been actively learning how to use this software through the past 2 assignments, so no new skills are needed for a program like this.</p>

									<h4>Skills:</h4>
									<p>Using the swing2app or flutter program mentioned in the prior section will require knowledge in the dart programming language for the flutter program. This can be leant quite easily as once learnt one programming language, as majority of is have, a second language will have similarities and be less of a challenge. A free and efficient way to learn Dart can be YouTube video as there is a plethora of tutorials on there ranging in levels of skill so as you progress through the language you always have a resource to learn. Swing2app however, uses their own code free system to produce apps meaning instead of learning a language you can just learn this editing tool with drag and drops which is so much easier and faster.</p>

									<h4>Outcome:</h4>
									<p>If the project is successful, we will have produced a software that is ready to be implemented for use by tutors and students that can help them find each other and set up tutor meetings with each other through the in-app messaging system. We will have created a solution so users will be able to define what they desire in a tutor and from there pay and meet with their tutors. This program could likely create a way for all students to have better access to learning resources in any possible situation they could possibly be in. This meaning there is less of a restriction and more open learning so we can make education more accessible for the future.</p>
