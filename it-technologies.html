									<h3 class="major">Clouds, services, servers</h3>

									<h4>What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>
									<p>Cloud computing started from early network schematics as the computers connected to servers drawn could all be linked but when too many servers going over each other made a symbol of a cloud allowing for cloud computing to start. By 1996, cloud computing had been changed into cloud services, making it Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). In 2003, an amazon development team from South Africa presented a new idea, this was to make a system that was made of mostly web-based services. This would have been also fully automated which would require the least amount of system maintenance that other developers could use, and this idea became successful. This was where the growth of cloud computing started to spread and soon all types of companies started using this which increased their speed and reliability by a whole lot. This Amazon Web Services started being used for backing up data, recovering loss of data, software development and testing, and data analytics.</p>
									<p>As an example, cloud computing is used by companies so they do not have to buy their own data centers, they can buy virtual cloud service providers for rent so they can access apps to storage. This allows them to not have to put more cost into managing the centers or infrastructures that are bought but just rent virtual servers or services. Further into software as a service which can include customer relationship management, emails, virtual desktops, communication, and video games. Platform as a service can include e-commerce tools, databases, web servers, and development tools as examples. Infrastructure as a service can include virtual machines, servers, storage, load balancers, and networks as some examples. Cloud is another way of saying that any number of devices can access these services through the use of the internet.</p>
									<p>The future of cloud computing in the next 3 years includes Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform will continue to support the services that developers are using and are familiar with today. Cloud computing will change by increasing storage capacity in the future and lowering the price for more data to be stored. performance of internet enhancing over time as the network will be faster as the ability to get data and send it will become quicker when IoT and cloud computing help each other in evolving. It is also said that all three IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS will change and improve, specifically, software as a service will take up at least 60% of the workload. IaaS and PaaS will also increase as more organizations use it and as more join, cloud computing is available for both old and new organizations. Security for the data stored in the cloud needs to improve as the cyber-attacks have mostly been towards cryptocurrency. If this does not change attacks could spread to other parts of cloud computing. This also includes data privacy and how this needs to get improved before more companies or people lose their data or are exposed for everyone to see.</p>

									<h4>What is the likely impact? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>
									<p>The impacts that cloud computing brings are mostly advantages and the rest of the disadvantages having a chance to be changed within the future as cloud computing improves. These advantages include lower computer costs as hard disk space will not be needed as most applications work on the cloud now, so fewer DVD drives and other types needed that have been replaced by cloud computing. The performance of computers will improve as fewer programs will be running and taking up memory space. Software costs will also be lower or even free as cloud computing spreads and more application work on the cloud, this can include google docs. It will be easier to keep the computer up to date with software receiving the internet and instantly updating as they can automatically update. Multiple users can see and change a document when it is on the cloud, without having to share updates repeatedly. Unlimited storage on the cloud allows for virtual storage to be never-ending like google drive but it is not available for free. More data reliability includes a lower chance of losing data as the cloud holds multiple layers of security. Universal document access allows for users to visit their documents on any device and any location, only if there is an internet connection available. When changing devices or moving to another type of device, all the portable cloud applications and documents can be carried over if they were saved on the cloud and have an internet connection available. People who will be most affected include those related to education like students, financial, health, insurance, and home. From all the statistics, cloud computing is creating more jobs than eliminating, these jobs include cloud computing specialists, big data analysts, ride-sharing drivers, and driverless car engineers to name a few of the jobs that have been created.</p>

									<h4>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>
									<p>In our daily lives, we use the internet for all sorts of things, when you realize that all the websites or types of technology you have been using are cloud computing-based related it will surprise you. Software as a Service can include Outlook, Hotmail, Gmail, Apple iCloud, and Dropbox, which are software we have used before and cannot deny we can live without as it is part of our daily lives. Platform as a Service includes websites and their databases that are connected to some websites we have used often as they are connected to Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Backup as a Service is also very well known as pictures, videos, financial details, and other personal data can be backed up on the cloud. This can include a website like google drive, which can allow for the data stored in them to be available for those in different locations and using different devices if they have the login and internet connection. Disaster Recovery as a Service is a backup to all the stored data on the cloud to be saved just in case accidents occur in the original place the data came from. All the websites or software we have used and that we found efficient must have a connection to cloud computing as the website itself may be working on infrastructure as a service. From all these services being applied, we can save data knowing there are backups to save any loss of precious information, work, or pictures. This will be beneficial for our family members as they also can use these types of websites that support a high amount of storage or able to use mailing accounts on the cloud. This will be beneficial for friends or group members because we can all work together on projects, able to save memories where they cannot be lost, and overall ability to use the internet with data on the cloud that can be accessed anytime.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Cybersecurity</h3>

									<h4>What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>
									<p>Cybersecurity is a digital method of protecting systems, networks and any programs from potential cyber threats. These cyber-attacks come in many forms which include, malware, ransomware, phishing attacks, man-in-the-middle and many more. It helps keep these systems safe and contained, therefore preventing any digital attacks and infiltration of any sort of these systems. It is essential for important systems used in the government, military, major companies or corporate businesses in order to maintain data integrity and prevent any sort of cyber threats or attacks.</p>
									<p>As technology evolves and is constantly advancing, there are new ways to hack or attack systems every day, ultimately increasing the importance of cybersecurity. However because of this, cybersecurity was also able to improve and obtain heavier and more secure protection. Due to the constant increase of cyber-attacks, organisations all over the world have turned to human-centric cybersecurity. This form of cybersecurity allows humans to take control more than machines or programs to protect their systems. By having humans having a higher percentage of participation and control over the security of these systems, they are able to gain a deeper understanding of how users interact with the data and the possible risks that are the outcome of these interactions. As humans are the users and the creators of our technologies and systems, humans have the ability to approach situations with a deeper understanding and knowledge of these potential cyber-attacks and threats.</p>
									<p>The most common uses of cybersecurity known today are the prevention of viruses in our computer systems or even the prevention of hackers through unsecure passwords for our online accounts. There have been many new methods in which can prevent any potential hackers from attacking these accounts through simple 2 step authentications or even just more complex passwords with symbols, numbers and different case letters embedded.</p>
									<p>According to chief security scientists, ransomware will be emerging in larger numbers and execute more threats for the next few years. As ransomware is constantly evolving along with today’s technology, the attacks and threats will therefore be more difficult to detect and counterattack. Ransomware attacks are especially important to be eliminated as they target all user groups such as any companies, the governments, hospitals and many more. A new and arising development for aiding the protection of any sort of systems is the use of quantum technology and how it affects the encryption methods we use. This advancement will possibly be evident more in the near future as encryption still requires more exploration and understanding of its potential use to its fullest capacity. Encryption is also another emerging method of cybersecurity known for its efficiency in protecting data as simple as texts, emails and bank information.</p>
									<p>There is a huge variety of technologies and software available for use for the average person which provide protection for endpoint devices such as computers, mobiles, routers, networks and the cloud. As these all may be present in any individual’s life, there are many technologies and software’s to choose to provide protection from unwanted external users. Common technology used for these purposes include next-generation firewalls, DNS filtering, antivirus software’s, </p>
									<p>Context-Aware Behavioural Analytics, Virtual Dispersive Networking (VDN), malware protection just to name a few. Context-Aware Behavioural Analytics is a common form of cybersecurity mainly for larger organisations. It uses sophisticated behavioural analytics to supervise and identify any apprehensive interactions and transactions towards their data and systems. This type of security is more efficient than static infrastructure security such as firewalls and antivirus software which do not possess the highly advanced and sensitive data of the world of technology today. Another standard form of cybersecurity is Virtual Dispersive Networking (VDN) which is mainly utilised to counterattack MIM (man-in-the-middle) attacks. This allows this method to actively seek the attacker who is essentially breaking through the systems from internally to the outside, interrupting the communication between the sender and receiver and its pathway. VDN are highly valued in large companies or government settings due to its ability to maintain data integrity as they are associated with commercial industries with high-value targets such as banks and utilities. Therefore are replacing Virtual Private Networks (VPN’s) as VDN’s provide greater security and infrastructure allowing a smoother management and thereby performance.</p>

									<h4>What is the likely impact? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>
									<p>A lack of cybersecurity can be a major risk for a company and its database systems. Without cybersecurity, companies could potentially experience a cyberattack and may be left with a large cost in order to repair the damage that was caused on the systems. Therefore cybersecurity has been able to play a major role in being beneficial to many businesses’ economical costs. A company’s reputation could potentially be damaged or negatively influenced due to their lack of cybersecurity and therefore costing their company’s image. This could’ve been prevented with the presence of a strong data protection software such as a Data loss prevention (DLP) software tool.  This may cause loss of trust between the company and consumers as well as potential future customers. According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), organisations may suffer from regulatory fines due to any potential cyber-threats. The GDPR is a law which ensures specifically for the European Union, that data protection is established in organisations in order to protect their personal information and any sensitive data within their systems.</p>
									<p>The importance of cybersecurity for companies and in individual’s lives is constantly increasing overtime due to technology evolving every day. Cyber-attacks are more harmful than ever and most likely never stop. This will cause an increase in demand for jobs associated with cybersecurity for both small and larger companies. As more businesses turn digital and rely on computer systems to store their essential data, the need for data protection has raised in priority, therefore providing more job opportunities in the cybersecurity field. Due to covid-19, more companies and individuals have switched to operate remotely, therefore involving more cyber experts who have the ability to prevent malicious attacks and detect any potential data breaches in the near future.</p>

									<h4>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>
									<p>As technology becomes increasingly advanced overtime, those without the required expertise and skills in cybersecurity are more vulnerable to cyberthreats and attacks. These may occur simply in our own homes and could affect how we use technology in our daily lives. Many individuals and families may even be unaware of the possibility of a cyberattack, therefore being at a higher risk than organisations who possess a cybersecurity system. There are individuals or employees who lack the knowledge of cyber-attacks or threats and could potentially provide a gateway for a hacker to gain access to their organisations data systems and information unintentionally through an infected attachment or to a phishing scam.</p>
									<p>Many common mistakes that individuals make that could lead to possible cyber-attacks are due to their weak passwords or pins. This could increase the vulnerability to the individuals accounts such as emails, social media accounts, banking sites and many more. This also applies to passwords to gain access to their electronic devices such as mobiles phones, computers or laptops. Passwords require a lot of complexity with the use of numbers and symbols to ensure greater security. Simple requirements like these may save your personal or company’s information from being lost or loss of access.</p>
									<p>In this highly digitally based time, nearly every piece of technology in which we possess is connected to a source of internet and WIFI. This includes phones, computers, tablets and even refrigerators in which all could be potentially hacked and experience a data breach due to a lack of cybersecurity. Devices that are connected to any source of WIFI or internet are more vulnerable to being hijacked as many hackers have the ability to gain access to these wifi connections and therefore all the devices that are connected to it. However, this can be avoided through many preventative measures which can be performed such as installing refutable security and anti-virus softwares, changing passwords on a regular basis and remaining aware of email attachments to prevent any phishing scams.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h3>

									<h4>What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>
									<p>A block chain stores and structures crypto currency transactions, legal contracts and inventory products into chunks, otherwise known as blocks, unlike most database which store data in tables with rows and columns, blockchain forms a chainlike formation. These blocks are all connected to one another and allow for crypto/ online currencies to be transferred legitimately and successfully between users. For example, bitcoin requires a set of computers to store its blockchain, these blockchains store every bitcoin transaction that have occurred throughout its history. What makes bitcoins database unique is that its computers are not under one roof, instead each group of computers or single computers are operated by a unique individual or individuals. These computers that make up bitcoins network are called nodes. In a blockchain, each node has a full record of the data that has been stored on the blockchain since its inception. For Bitcoin, the data is the entire history of all Bitcoin transactions. If one node has an error in its data it can use many other nodes as a reference point to correct itself. This way, no one node of the network can alter information held within it. Because of this, the history of transactions in each block that make up Bitcoin’s blockchain cannot be reversed.</p>
									<p>Block chains seemingly tamper proof design saw it become heralded as the next big thing in emerging technology a couple of years ago. A study done by statista revealed that 33% of global organisations have said that their companies are working on creating a digital currency using blockchain resulting in an increase from $3 billion in 2020 to $39 billion by 2025. This data shows how much of an impact block chain will have on the world in the next few years. Despite the future benefits, blockchain is also currently being used in several other ways which include payment processing and money transfers, monetization of supply chains, digital IDs, copyright and royalty protection and many more. Crypto currency is another major technology that has been protected and managed with the help of block chain, this has allowed crypto currencies like bitcoin grow exponentially in the past 5 years. As crypto currencies grow they provide many advantages to their owners, one benefit includes a lower transaction fee. When you check the bank statement, you would be cribbing on the transaction fee charged for every transaction you are carrying out. If you are performing a lot of transactions every month, then the fee would be whopping. The data miners would receive their compensation from the cryptocurrency network, so there would be no charge or very less charge on the transaction fee. If you are entrusting the responsibility of maintaining your crypto wallet to the third party, you must pay for the service. However, the transaction fees charged by cryptocurrency transactions would be lesser compared to the traditional financial system.</p>
									<p>The main way blockchain is maintained is through a process called mining, this is where miners create new blocks on the chain by making a unique hash and nonce. This process is very complex and difficult but It ultimately allows for block chain to be a secure and safe technology.</p>
									<p>In finance, CPA auditors audit and help multi trillion dollar capital markets system function with high confidence. CPA auditors practice under strict regulations, professional codes of conduct and auditing standards, and are independent of the entities they audit. They apply objectivity and professional scepticism to provide reasonable assurance about whether an entity’s financial statements are free of material misstatement and, depending on the engagement, about whether a company’s internal controls over financial reporting are operating effectively. Some publications have signalled that blockchain technology may eliminate the need for a financial statement audit by a CPA auditor altogether. If all transactions are captured in an immutable blockchain, there will not be much left for the CPA auditor to edit. Also, a blockchain that records the transfer of a particular currency may make it difficult for the CPA auditor to determine what the product was solely by looking at the block chain. Therefore a transaction recorded in a block chain may still be unauthorised, fraudulent or illegal and incorrectly classified in financial statements.</p>

									<h4>What is the likely impact? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>
									<p>Advancements in blockchain can impact almost every industry, in retail individual shoppers, either at a store or online, placing their trust in retail systems. With blockchain, buyers and sellers could potentially come together directly, eliminating the middleman and keeping prices competitive. Smart contracts could also be developed to enhance this process and increase security as well. Real estate can be improved with blockchain, as seen throughout history the real estate industry has been susceptible to fraud and bureaucracy because of a lack of transparency. Public record mistakes are also common too, blockchains could help to speed up the industry and keep the record honest.</p>
									<p>Crypto currencies and blockchains create many job opportunities for people who specialise in artificial intelligence and web services. In the future, there will be even greater demand for web developers, data scientists, technical writers, security and encryption specialists. Jobs that will mostly be at risk are those connected with office work paperwork and all kinds of verification and certification. Blockchain will not need auditors because all the transactions will be confirmed and finalised mathematically. Some experts claim the first areas to be hit will be the ones that are connected with reconciliation activities because we will not need it anymore.</p>

									<h4>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>
									<p>Blockchain and crypto currency will allow for a wide range of investment opportunities for me and plenty of others who are looking to invest in crypto currency. Plenty of future jobs will also become available, this will be very beneficial for me as I am in the IT field and interested in how blockchains are formed and maintained successfully. My current life will not drastically change as I cannot really mine currencies in an efficient way, for now I can only make minor investments until I find a career. As for my family, their industries include trade work, phone repairs and accounting, these areas are not significantly impacted by blockchain, so the effect will not be as great when compared to an IT or computer science person.</p>
