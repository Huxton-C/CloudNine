									<h3 class="major">Similarities</h3>
									<h4>Career</h4>
									<p>In the CloudNine team, all the members have chosen jobs they would like to do in the future and planned out how they will get to the position needed to get the job. None of the members had the same job but had similar elements. This can include how Huxton, Muhammad Khan, and Annie had engineering in their job. This means they will be professionally trained in certain aspects of development and implementation for a specific area of technology. This can be seen as the three members will all be professionally trained in the cloud, network, or software/quality assurance engineering.</p>

									<p>Another similarity can be seen between Shahan, Annie, and Muhammad Imran as they wish to learn further on software. The only difference being Muhammad Imran learning on software development, Annie wishes to study software engineering, and Shahan wishing to study further on software to become a testing consultant. This means Muhammad Imran programming and developing the server, app, or website, Annie connecting the server to the app and website and lastly, Shahan being able to tell the stakeholders about the quality of the software. </p>

									<p>Another similar element was between Huxton, Alex, and Ahmed as they state about the specific status they want to reach or start as. Huxton and Ahmed both wishing to reach a senior point in their employment status but to reach there they would all have to start as juniors where Alex would also wish to start as a website developer and designer. This meaning starting with an experience of 1 to 3 years for most jobs and reaching 6 years and more experience for Huxton and Ahmed.</p>

									<h4>Path</h4>
									<p>There were not any other common elements in the jobs our group members wish to do in the future but there were some in the path they wish to follow. One common element included Huxton, Muhammad Khan, and Annie mentioning they need computer science as their qualification, or some degree related to that field. This shows that their ideal job needs knowledge in computer science or a related field to get the job.</p>

									<p>Huxton, Muhammad Khan, Alex, Annie, and Ahmed said that they need IT-specific skills and knowledge to get closer to getting their job as the knowledge will be only received if the members have experience in these specific IT skills and knowledge. The difference being all the skills and knowledge needed were different for each member in the group. </p>

									<p>Huxton, Alex, Annie, Ahmed, and Shahan stated that they also need general skills to have a higher chance of receiving the job as these are some of the requirements. All these members state that they need good communication skills to perform better when they receive the job. Huxton and Annie also having the skill to work with a team or group for another general skill with Ahmed having a somewhat similar skill needed being having good leadership for the group he will be working with. Another similarity is that Huxton, Ahmed, and Shahan needing a specific number of years of experience to reach the requirement for their jobs. This being 3 years for Huxton and 5 years or more for Ahmed and Shahan.</p>
